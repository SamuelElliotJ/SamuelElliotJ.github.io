                <p>
                    This is a project i worked on as part of my universities 1UP initiative, which brought together students from a range of games courses and year groups to collaborate on a project. For this project i was part of the tech team and did visual scripting in Unreal Engine 5.<br><br>
                    Staffsverse is a virtual campus game which has the aim of helping new students used to the campus before they arrive. It will eventually be a 1:1 scale of the real Staffordshire University Campus.

                <h2>Learning Outcomes:</h2>
                <p>This project was my first time using Unreal Engine 5, so i first familiarised myself with the new layout and i then began working. My first task was a simple minimap which is something i had done before so i finished it relatively quick. The next task was to create the emote wheel to the design specifications which had it as a radial menu, i hadn't done any radial UI before but with some research i quickly found out how to do it. My final task was to make a system to load and unload sublebvels, this took me the longest as i had never approached this before but i managed to get a basic system up and running.</p>
